## What is Automated Testing ##

Write code to test the code of yoru application, and then repeatedly run the
tests in automated fashion.

There will be two separated codes:

- The application code: for production / development
- The testing code: to test the application code

### Manual testing ###

- Not as efficient as Unit Testing
- In order to test a class logic, you might have to:
  - Launch the application
  - Login / Register
  - Navigate to the desired page
  - Populate details
  - Verify results

### Automated testing ###

- Write once, run often
- Execute anytime
- Catch bugs before deploying
- Very reliable and efficient
- Confidant deployment
